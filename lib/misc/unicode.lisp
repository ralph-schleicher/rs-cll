;;; Code:

(in-package :rs-cll)

(defun string-from-octets (sequence &optional (encoding :UTF-8))
  (babel:octets-to-string
   (coerce sequence '(vector (unsigned-byte 8)))
   :encoding encoding))

(export 'unicode-string-reader)
(defun unicode-string-reader (stream sub-char arg)
  "Read a sequence of Unicode characters and return it as a Lisp string.

The Unicode characters are represented as a list of non-negative
integral numbers.  Prefix argument defines the Unicode encoding.
A value of 8 means UTF-8, 16 means UTF-16BE, 32 means UTF-32BE,
2 means UCS-2BE, and 4 means UCS-4BE.  Without prefix argument,
the encoding defaults to UTF-8.

You can enable this feature by evaluating the form

     (eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
       (set-dispatch-macro-character #\\# #\\U #'unicode-string-reader))

After that, you can read literal Unicode strings via

     #U(71 114 105 97 195 159 32 100 105 39) ;\"Griaß di\"

If the first element of the list is a string, it is discarded.
This feature can be used instead of a comment to record the
original string.  For example,

     #U(\"Griaß di'\"
        71 114 105 97 195 159 32 100 105 39)"
  (declare (ignore sub-char))
  (let ((encoding (ecase arg
		    ((8 nil) :UTF-8)
		    (16 :UTF-16BE)
		    (32 :UTF-32BE)
		    (2 :UCS-2BE)
		    (4 :UCS-4BE)))
	(octets (progn
		  ;; Read a list.
		  (unless (char= (read-char stream t nil t) #\()
		    (error 'parse-error))
		  (read-delimited-list #\) stream t))))
    (when (stringp (first octets))
      (setf octets (rest octets)))
    (string-from-octets octets encoding)))
