(export 'q-reader)
(defun q-reader (stream sub-char arg)
  "Read a quoted text.

First character is the delimiting character.  Non-bracketing
delimiters use the same character fore and aft.  Round brackets,
angle brackets, square brackets, and curly brackets always match
the other character of the pair.

Without prefix argument, bracketing delimiters nest.  If prefix
argument is zero, bracketing delimiters use the same character
fore and aft, that means they are treated like a non-bracketing
delimiting character.  If prefix argument is a postive number,
bracketing delimiters do not nest, that means the first matching
other character of the pair terminates reading.

You can enable this feature by evaluating the form

     (set-dispatch-macro-character #\\# #\\q #'q-reader)

After that, you can read literal strings via

     #q|He said \"Quote me!\"|
or
     #q<<tag attr=\"val\">text</tag>>
but
     #q(\")\")

will fail, because the q-reader function is not a parser for any
particular grammar."
